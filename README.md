# Surfs_up
## Summary 
The purpose of this analysis was to assess the feasibility of an icecream and surf shop where temperature ia concerned. I wanted to assess the tempuratures for both June and December to understand the fluctuation in temperatures. 

## Results 
based on the sumarry statistics there is no reason to be concerned about the fluctuation in tempuratures as it pertains to operating an icecream and surf business

## June:

Two additional queries to perform: 
- what is the fluctuation of temp over time of day
- how much sunshine is there by month on average
